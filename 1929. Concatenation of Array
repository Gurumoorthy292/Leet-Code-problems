Given an integer array nums of length n, you want to create an array ans of length 2n where ans[i] == nums[i] and ans[i + n] == nums[i] for 0 <= i < n (0-indexed).
Specifically, ans is the concatenation of two nums arrays.
Return the array ans.

SOURCE CODE:

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> getConcatenation(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            nums.push_back(nums[i]);
        }
        return nums;
    }
};

OUTPUT:

Example 1:
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
Explanation:
There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form "bat".
The strings "nat" and "tan" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
The strings "ate", "eat", and "tea" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.

Example 2:
Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]

Example 3:
Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
