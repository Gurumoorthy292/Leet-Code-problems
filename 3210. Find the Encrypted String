3210. Find the Encrypted String

You are given a string s and an integer k. Encrypt the string using the following algorithm:
For each character c in s, replace c with the kth character after c in the string (in a cyclic manner).
Return the encrypted string

SOURCE CODE:

void encryptString(char* s, int k) {
    int n = strlen(s);
    char result[100];  // Make sure it's large enough
    k = k % n;  // Handle large values of k

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        result[i] = s[(i + k) % n];  // Shift character k steps forward cyclically
    }
    result[n] = '\0';  // Null-terminate the string

    printf("Encrypted String: %s\n", result);
}

OUTPUT:

 
Example 1:
Input: s = "dart", k = 3
Output: "tdar"
Explanation:

For i = 0, the 3rd character after 'd' is 't'.
For i = 1, the 3rd character after 'a' is 'd'.
For i = 2, the 3rd character after 'r' is 'a'.
For i = 3, the 3rd character after 't' is 'r'.

Example 2:

Input: s = "aaa", k = 1

Output: "aaa"

Explanation:

As all the characters are the same, the encrypted string will also be the same.
