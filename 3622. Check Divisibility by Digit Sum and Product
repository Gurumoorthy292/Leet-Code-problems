You are given a positive integer n. Determine whether n is divisible by the sum of the following two values:
The digit sum of n (the sum of its digits).
The digit product of n (the product of its digits).
Return true if n is divisible by this sum; otherwise, return false

SOURCE CODE:

bool checkDivisibility(int n) {
    if (n < 0) return false; // Handle negative numbers

    int digitSum = 0, digitProduct = 1, num = n;

    while (num) {
        int digit = num % 10;
        digitSum += digit;
        digitProduct *= digit;
        num /= 10;
    }

    int total = digitSum + digitProduct;
    if (total == 0) return false; // Prevent division by zero

    return (n % total == 0);
}

OUTPUT:

Example 1:
Input: n = 99
OuTput: true
Explanation:
Since 99 is divisible by the sum (9 + 9 = 18) plus product (9 * 9 = 81) of its digits (total 99), the output is true.

Example 2:
Input: n = 23
Output: false
Explanation:
Since 23 is not divisible by the sum (2 + 3 = 5) plus product (2 * 3 = 6) of its digits (total 11), the output is false.
